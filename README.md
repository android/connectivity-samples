Connectivity Samples Repository
===============================

This repository contains a set of individual Android Studio projects to help you get started writing Connectivity apps in Android.

If you find an issue or bug in one of the projects, feel free to file an issue on this repository with the following information:
- The specific project that pertains to the issue (for example: the 'BluetoothLeGatt' project)
- Steps to repro the issue, including the API version and Android device model

Example of a good issue:
In the BluetoothLeGatt sample, I am unable to see any BLE devices after the initial scan. I ran the sample on a Pixel 2 running API version 28.

Examples of bad issues:
1. Bluetooth scanning doesn't work.
2. My app is crashing when I try to send a large file.
3. How can I support BLE in my app?

Requests for samples related to Android connectivity are also welcome.
